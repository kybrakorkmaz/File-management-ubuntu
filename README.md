# File-management-ubuntu
I used some popular linux file management command in this bash script.
Help bash file describes how to use this program. And it has description of some commands.
Main project is menu bash file, rest of them I created for convenience in order to use file management commands such as searching files and their permission or coping file to another destinations.
